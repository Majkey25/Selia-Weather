For a batched cohort request, calls are
`candidates × ceil(locations/location_batch_limit) × ceil(variables/variable_batch_limit) × (1 + dates × runs)`.
The guard requires calls to be strictly below `10,000`; `10,000` itself fails closed.

Successful probes record the endpoint, sorted non-secret request parameters, requested and
provider model IDs, and per-location response metadata. Definitive model exclusions are kept
separately from operational failures. The output is `complete` only when every attempted probe
finished without an operational failure; otherwise it is `incomplete` and the CLI exits nonzero.
